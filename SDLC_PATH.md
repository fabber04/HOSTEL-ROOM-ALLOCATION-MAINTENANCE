# SDLC Stages - Current Project Path

## Overview
This document outlines which Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) stages we are following for the Hostel Room Allocation and Maintenance System prototype.

---

## ✅ COMPLETED STAGES

### 1. **Planning & Requirements Gathering** ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE

**What we did:**
- Created Problem Definition document
- Identified stakeholders (Students, Staff, Administration)
- Defined functional and non-functional requirements
- Documented constraints and assumptions
- Set acceptance criteria for prototype

**Deliverables:**
- `Problem_Definition.txt` - Complete problem statement and requirements

---

### 2. **System Design & Prototyping** ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE

**What we did:**
- Created clickable HTML prototype
- Designed user flows for:
  - Student: Request room → Check status → Submit maintenance
  - Staff: Allocate rooms → Manage work orders
- Implemented UI/UX with navigation and interactions
- Created database documentation (reference only)

**Deliverables:**
- `prototype/` - Complete HTML prototype with all screens
- `database/DATABASE_DOCUMENTATION.txt` - Database structure reference
- Working prototype deployed on GitHub Pages

**Prototype Features:**
- ✅ Login/role selection
- ✅ Student dashboard and flows
- ✅ Staff dashboard and flows
- ✅ Room request and status tracking
- ✅ Maintenance request system
- ✅ Work order management

---

## 🔄 CURRENT STAGE

### 3. **Prototype Testing & Validation** 🔄
**Status:** IN PROGRESS / READY FOR TESTING

**What we need to do:**
- Conduct usability testing with 5-7 users
- Gather feedback on:
  - Navigation clarity
  - Task completion rates
  - User satisfaction
- Document findings
- Iterate based on feedback

**Next Steps:**
1. Recruit test users (students and staff)
2. Create test scenarios
3. Conduct usability sessions
4. Document results
5. Make improvements based on feedback

---

## 📋 UPCOMING STAGES (If Moving to Full Implementation)

### 4. **Development/Implementation** 📋
**Status:** NOT STARTED

**What would be done:**
- Set up backend (API, database)
- Implement frontend application
- Integrate authentication
- Build actual functionality (not just prototype)

**Note:** Currently skipped - we're in prototype phase only.

---

### 5. **Testing** 📋
**Status:** NOT STARTED (for full system)

**What would be done:**
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- System testing
- User acceptance testing (UAT)

**Note:** Prototype testing is separate (see Current Stage above).

---

### 6. **Deployment** 📋
**Status:** PARTIALLY DONE (Prototype only)

**What we did:**
- Deployed prototype to GitHub Pages
- Made it publicly accessible

**What would be done for full system:**
- Set up production environment
- Deploy backend and frontend
- Configure database
- Set up monitoring

---

### 7. **Maintenance** 📋
**Status:** NOT APPLICABLE (Prototype phase)

**What would be done:**
- Bug fixes
- Feature updates
- Performance optimization
- User support

---

## 📊 SDLC MODEL BEING FOLLOWED

**Model:** **Agile/Iterative Prototype Model**

**Why:**
- We're building a prototype first to validate concepts
- Quick iteration based on feedback
- Focus on user experience before full implementation
- Reduced risk through early validation

**Stages in our path:**
```
1. Planning ✅
2. Design/Prototype ✅
3. Testing (Prototype) 🔄 ← YOU ARE HERE
4. Iteration (if needed)
5. Full Implementation (future)
```

---

## 🎯 CURRENT FOCUS

**Primary Goal:** Validate the prototype with real users

**Key Activities:**
1. ✅ Problem definition - DONE
2. ✅ Prototype creation - DONE
3. 🔄 Usability testing - NEXT
4. 📝 Documentation of findings
5. 🔄 Iteration based on feedback

---

## 📝 DELIVERABLES STATUS

| Deliverable | Status | Location |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Problem Definition | ✅ Complete | `Problem_Definition.txt` |

---

## 🚀 NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS

1. **Create Usability Test Plan**
   - Define test scenarios
   - Prepare test tasks
   - Recruit participants

2. **Conduct Testing**
   - Run usability sessions
   - Collect feedback
   - Document observations

3. **Analyze Results**
   - Identify issues
   - Prioritize improvements
   - Plan iterations

4. **Iterate Prototype**
   - Fix critical issues
   - Improve based on feedback
   - Re-test if needed
