DATABASE DOCUMENTATION
Hostel Room Allocation and Maintenance System

This document describes the database structure that would be needed for the full implementation.

DATABASE OVERVIEW
- Database Type: PostgreSQL (recommended) or MySQL
- Purpose: Store user data, room allocations, maintenance requests, and system records

MAIN ENTITIES

1. Users
   - Stores student and staff account information
   - Fields: id, email, password_hash, name, role (student/staff/admin)
   - Authentication: JWT-based

2. Hostels
   - Hostel building information
   - Fields: id, name, address, capacity

3. Rooms
   - Individual room details
   - Fields: id, hostel_id, room_number, room_type (single/double/triple/quad), capacity, floor, status (available/occupied/maintenance)

4. Room Requests
   - Student room allocation requests
   - Fields: id, student_id, hostel_id, room_type, semester, special_requirements, status (pending/allocated/rejected)

5. Room Allocations

RELATIONSHIPS
- Users → Room Requests (one-to-many)
- Users → Room Allocations (one-to-many)
- Users → Maintenance Requests (one-to-many)
- Hostels → Rooms (one-to-many)
- Rooms → Room Allocations (one-to-many)
- Rooms → Maintenance Requests (one-to-many)

NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION
- Use UUIDs for primary keys
- Implement proper indexing on foreign keys and frequently queried fields
- Add audit trails (created_at, updated_at timestamps)
- Consider soft deletes for data retention
- Implement proper backup and recovery procedures
- Use transactions for critical operations (room allocation, status updates)
