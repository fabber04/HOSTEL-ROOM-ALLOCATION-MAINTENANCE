**3. Key Findings**

**3.1 Current State Analysis**

**Manual Process Challenges:**
- Institutions rely heavily on spreadsheets, email communication, and paper forms
- Room allocation decisions are made manually, leading to inconsistencies
- No centralized system for tracking requests and allocations
- Maintenance requests are submitted via various channels (email, phone, in-person)
- Status updates are communicated inconsistently
- Limited transparency for students regarding allocation decisions
- No audit trail for allocation and maintenance decisions

**Pain Points Identified:**

**For Students:**
- Uncertainty about request status and timeline
- Lack of visibility into available options
- Difficulty tracking maintenance requests
- No clear communication channel with staff
- Frustration with allocation delays

**For Staff:**
- Time-consuming manual processes
- Difficulty managing multiple requests simultaneously
- Lack of organized system for tracking work orders
- Challenges in maintaining fair allocation policies
- Limited ability to generate reports and analytics

**For Administration:**
- No centralized data for decision-making
- Difficulty in planning and resource allocation
- Limited ability to analyze trends and patterns
- Compliance and audit challenges

**3.2 Existing Solutions Analysis**

**Commercial Solutions:**
- Several commercial property management systems exist but are often expensive
- Many solutions are designed for hotels, not educational institutions
- Complex features that may not be necessary for hostel management
- Limited customization options

**Open-Source Solutions:**
- Few open-source solutions specifically for hostel management
- Most require significant technical expertise to implement
- Limited support and documentation
- May not address all specific needs of educational institutions

**Custom Solutions:**
- Some institutions have developed custom solutions
- Often lack modern user interfaces
- May not be scalable or maintainable
- Limited integration capabilities

**3.3 Stakeholder Requirements**

**Student Requirements:**
- Easy-to-use interface for submitting requests
- Real-time status updates on room requests
- Simple process for reporting maintenance issues
- Transparent communication about allocation decisions
- Mobile-friendly access

**Staff Requirements:**
- Efficient interface for reviewing and allocating rooms
- Organized view of all pending requests
- Easy status updates for maintenance work orders
- Ability to add notes and track progress
- Quick access to student information

**Administration Requirements:**
- Data collection and reporting capabilities
- Audit trail for all decisions
- Analytics and trend analysis
- Integration with existing systems
- Scalable solution for future growth
